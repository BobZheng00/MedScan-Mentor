**[Introduction]**

"Welcome to MedScan, an innovative educational platform designed to assist medical students in detecting and analyzing brain diseases through CT scans. MedScan is your mentor, guiding you through the process of identifying brain disorders with advanced technology and expert knowledge."

**[Training the Model]**

"For our MedScan, trained using YOLOv5, the object detection framework. We've utilized the Brain Tumor Detection Dataset, which contains over 5,200 high-quality MRI images. These images are annotated with bounding boxes for different classes of brain tumors


**[User Interaction with MedScan]**

"As you could see the screen, After uploading a brain CT scan, you're invited to manually draw a bounding box around the area you believe contains a disease. MedScan then compares your input with the model's detection, meanwhile, you could also offer your interpretation on this specific CT Scans"

**[Educational Report Generation]**

"Once your input is analyzed, MedScan goes a step further by generating a comprehensive educational report. This report not only interprets your findings but also educates you on the specific brain disease detected. To enrich your learning experience, MedScan uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, to fetch the latest articles from PubMed, a leading resource for biomedical literature."

"These articles are combined to create an educational report, giving you in-depth knowledge and the latest research insights related to the brain condition identified."

**[Data Storage and Future Reference]**

"MedScan values your learning journey, which is why all reports are securely stored in MongoDB. This includes your selected bounding box, the correct bounding box, your interpretation, and MedScan's feedback. You can revisit these reports at any time, allowing for continuous learning and growth."

**[Conclusion]**

"MedScan is more than just a tool; it's a mentor. By offering hands-on experience in brain disease detection and a wealth of educational content, MedScan helps you become proficient in medical analysis, preparing you for a successful career in the medical field."

"Thank you for choosing MedScan as your educational partner. Together, we're shaping the future of medical education."
